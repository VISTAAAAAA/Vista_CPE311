CONCLUSION:

Doing data collection and wrangling is a bit tricky but another learning for me, I really enjoyed the Exercise 3 
where I did web scraping and I was able to learn it and break some code where I was able to scrape the data that 
I needed and with this activity, I learned new knowledge that I can use for my future projects.
