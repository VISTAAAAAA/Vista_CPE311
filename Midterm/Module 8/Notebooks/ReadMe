SUMMARY OF MY LEARNING: 

I WAS ABLE TO LEARN A LOT OF TERMS AND METHOD IN THIS MODULE, FROM WEATHER DATA COLLECTION, 8.1 UP TO TIME SERIES 8.5;
WITH THIS LEARNING THAT I GET, I HOPE THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY THEM IN REAL WORLD PROBLEM OR SCENARIO,
SUCH AS COLLECTING DATA WITH API AND BY THAT I COULD GET OR WRANGLE THE DATA WITH THE OTHER MODULE LEARNINGS THAT I LEARN LIKE 
AGGREGATION, DATAFRAME OPERATIONS, TIME SERIES AND QUERY AND MERGING;
I FIND QUERY AND MERGING AND AGGREGATION MORE HANDFUL OR IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MASTER BECAUSE I THINK CAN BE USED TO
A LOT OF PROBLEMS OR DATA IN MY FUTURE LEARNING BECAUSE OF THEIR FUNCTION TO THE DATAS;
I HOPE BY THE NEXT MODULE AND ACTIVITIES, I COULD LEARN AND PRACTICE WHAT I DID AND LEARNED FROM THIS MODULE SO 
IT WILL REALLY DIG IN TO MY BRAIN AND MASTER THEM.
