In this activity, I was able to learn Seaborn, formatting plots and making custom visualizations on Seaborn;
I was able to make visualization of the look of the data in different kinds of plots or visualization,
I was able to choose and customize the plot or graph that I wanted to get or have, 
and in this activity, I was able somehow to apply my learnings from the last HOA and be able to 
use it to fetchd data and make it a visualization out of it in this activity, I hope by the next activity,
my knowledge in handling data and data analysis widen furthermore.
