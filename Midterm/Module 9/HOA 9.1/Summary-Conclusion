In this Activity, I was able to learn Matplotlib, plottings, and plotting Subpackage
I was also be able to apply my learning to the supplementary where I find my learning in the 
procedures helpful to answer the Supplementary activity,
I did tried to conduct or apply what I learned from the previous module and I found 
that when we are going deeper into pandas or data analysis tools, the best ways pops up
and let go of the basic ways or syntax to wrangle or get data, which is a good part on
what I can choose to apply because applying what I am using in this acitivity is a time
saver and a must so I can enhance my skills and knowledge in data analysis.
I hope by the next activity, I could be able to apply what I learned from this activity.
